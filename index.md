## Who Am I?

* I'm a junior currently attending Carroll Senior High School.

* I'm an aspiring CS major, and I plan on learning various programming languages besides Java including Python and C++. I am also learning the basics of HTML and web development.

* In addition, my brother is studying computer science as a freshman in college. I would say his career choice greatly influenced my views.
