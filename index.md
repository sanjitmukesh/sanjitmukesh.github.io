## Who Am I?

> I'm a junior currently attending Carroll Senior High School.
>
> I am an aspiring CS major, and plan on learning various programming languages including Python and C++.
>
> In addition, my brother is studying computer science as a freshman in college. I would say his career choice greatly influenced my views.


> Computer Science is a science of abstraction - creating the right model for a problem and deivsing the aprpiate mechanizable techniques to solve it.
